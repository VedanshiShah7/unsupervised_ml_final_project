## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the **Deep One-Class Classification** method for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data. We analyze baseline approaches and improve performance by experimenting with clustering algorithms like **KMeans++** and **DBSCAN** during post-processing.

The goal is to explore the challenges in unsupervised anomaly detection and improve performance by leveraging different unsupervised algorithms. The project includes visualizations of results and simulated anomaly detection predictions.
